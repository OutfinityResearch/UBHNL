# Test 12: Chemistry - Reaction
# STYLE: Mixed natural + explicit for complex predicates

Let Mol be a Domain.
Let H2 be a Mol.
Let O2 be a Mol.

# Reaction rule - natural predicates where possible
For all Mol m1, Mol m2:
    If $m1 is Present and $m2 is Present and $m1 reacts $m2 then $m1 combines $m2.

# Facts
H2 is Present.
O2 is Present.
H2 reacts O2.
