Proof ProducerDefinition:
    Given:
        c0 is a Cell.
        Definition Producer(Cell c): For all Protein p: If c expresses p then p is active.
    Query:
        Find a Cell that is a Producer.
    Found:
        c0 satisfies Producer definition if all proteins it expresses are active.
    Therefore:
        c0 is a candidate Producer.
