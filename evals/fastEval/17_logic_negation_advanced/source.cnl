# Test 17: Advanced Negation
# Testing complex negation patterns

Let Entity be a Domain.
Let e1, e2 be Entities.

# Mutual exclusion via negation
For any Entity x:
    If x is On then it is not the case that x is Off.
    If x is Off then it is not the case that x is On.

# Default closed-world: If not on, then off
For any Entity x:
    If it is not the case that x is On then x is Off.

# Facts
e1 is On.
It is not the case that e2 is On.
