# Test 18: Load Directive
# Testing theory loading from external files
# Path is RELATIVE to the current file's directory

// Load CNL theory (will be translated to DSL)
load "../../theories/domains/medical.cnl"

// Can also load DSL directly:
// load "../../theories/core/logic.sys2"

# Now we can use Patient, Flu, etc. from medical.cnl
Let p1 be a Patient.

# Fact: patient has flu
p1 has Flu.

# Rule from medical.cnl should apply: If $p has Flu then $p has Fever
