# Modal Logic Theory
# Possibility, necessity, temporal, and deontic operators
# Extends core logic with modal reasoning

# =============================================================================
# DOMAIN DECLARATIONS
# =============================================================================

World is a Domain.
Time is a Domain.
Agent is a Domain.

# =============================================================================
# ALETHIC MODALITY (Possibility/Necessity)
# =============================================================================

# Syntax:
#   "Possibly P"      -> Possibly P   (diamond operator)
#   "Necessarily P"   -> Necessarily P (box operator)
#   "P is possible"   -> Possibly P
#   "P is necessary"  -> Necessarily P

# Axioms (S5 Modal Logic):

# Axiom K: Distribution
# For any Proposition p, q:
#     If Necessarily (p implies q) then (Necessarily p) implies (Necessarily q).

# Axiom T: Necessity implies truth
# For any Proposition p:
#     If Necessarily p then p.

# Axiom 5: Positive introspection for possibility
# For any Proposition p:
#     If Possibly p then Necessarily (Possibly p).

# Duality: Possibly P iff not Necessarily (not P)

# =============================================================================
# TEMPORAL LOGIC (LTL-style)
# =============================================================================

# Syntax:
#   "Eventually P"    -> Eventually P    (future diamond)
#   "Always P"        -> Always P        (future box)
#   "Next P"          -> Next P          (next state)
#   "P until Q"       -> Until P Q       (strong until)

# Axioms:

# Eventually is reflexive
# For any Proposition p:
#     If p then Eventually p.

# Always implies current
# For any Proposition p:
#     If Always p then p.

# Until semantics
# For any Proposition p, q:
#     If p until q then Eventually q.

# =============================================================================
# EPISTEMIC LOGIC (Knowledge/Belief)
# =============================================================================

# Syntax:
#   "Agent knows P"      -> Knows Agent P
#   "Agent believes P"   -> Believes Agent P
#   "It is common knowledge that P" -> CommonKnowledge P

# Knowledge axioms (S5):

# Truthfulness: Knowledge implies truth
# For any Agent a, Proposition p:
#     If a knows p then p.

# Positive introspection: Knowing that you know
# For any Agent a, Proposition p:
#     If a knows p then a knows (a knows p).

# Negative introspection: Knowing that you don't know
# For any Agent a, Proposition p:
#     If it is not the case that a knows p then a knows (it is not the case that a knows p).

# Belief is weaker than knowledge (no truthfulness axiom)

# =============================================================================
# DEONTIC LOGIC (Obligation/Permission)
# =============================================================================

# Syntax:
#   "Permitted P"      -> Permitted P     (may)
#   "Obligatory P"     -> Obligatory P    (must)
#   "Forbidden P"      -> Forbidden P     (must not)

# Axioms:

# Duality: Permitted P iff not Obligatory (not P)
# For any Action a:
#     a is Permitted iff it is not the case that (not a) is Obligatory.

# Forbidden = Obligatory(not)
# For any Action a:
#     a is Forbidden iff (not a) is Obligatory.

# Ought implies can
# For any Action a:
#     If a is Obligatory then a is Possible.

# No conflicts
# For any Action a:
#     It is not the case that (a is Obligatory and a is Forbidden).

# =============================================================================
# COUNTERFACTUAL REASONING
# =============================================================================

# Syntax:
#   "If P were the case then Q would hold" -> Counterfactual P Q
#   "Had P been true then Q" -> Counterfactual P Q

# Lewis-Stalnaker semantics:
#   Counterfactual P Q is true iff in the closest possible world where P holds, Q also holds.

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLE: Legal Reasoning
# =============================================================================

# Rule application with obligations:
#   For any Person p:
#       If p is Adult then (p pays Taxes) is Obligatory.
#       If (p pays Taxes) is Obligatory and it is not the case that p pays Taxes then
#           (p is Penalized) is Permitted.

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLE: Agent Knowledge
# =============================================================================

# Information sharing:
#   For any Agent a, b, Proposition p:
#       If a knows p and a tells b then b knows p.

# Uncertainty:
#   For any Agent a, Proposition p:
#       If a believes p and it is not the case that a knows p then
#           a is Uncertain about p.
