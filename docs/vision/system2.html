          <h2>The Epistemological Challenge: Reliability in the Age of Autonomy</h2>
          <p>
            Large Language Models (LLMs) operate as sophisticated "System 1" engines: they provide rapid, intuitive, and probabilistic outputs. However, they lack an internal model of consistency, making them prone to hallucinations and logical contradictions. In autonomous systems—where an AI may be responsible for planning medical treatments or managing financial infrastructure—this lack of verifiability is a primary barrier to safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            UBHNL serves as the <strong>System 2 Counterpart</strong>. It provides the slow, methodical, and rule-based verification required to ground neural outputs in symbolic reality. By acting as a formal monitor, UBHNL ensures that the creative flexibility of the neural model is constrained by the non-negotiable laws of the domain.

          <h2>Mechanism: The Neuro-Symbolic Validation Loop</h2>
          <p>
            The interaction between a generative model and UBHNL follows a strict <strong>Verification Handshake</strong>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> The generative model drafts a candidate hypothesis, rule, or action plan based on unstructured input.</li>
            <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> The output is passed through an extraction gate that translates it into UBHNL’s deterministic front-end (CNL/DSL).</li>
            <li><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> The UBHNL Orchestrator evaluates the proposal against the authoritative knowledge base. This includes checking for internal consistency and entailment from established axioms.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> If a contradiction is detected, UBHNL returns an <strong>Unsat Core</strong>—a formal explanation of <em>why</em> the proposal is logically invalid. The generative model can then use this specific feedback to correct its "System 1" intuition.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Objective: Transparent and Proof-Carrying AI</h2>
          <p>
            By decoupling <em>meaning generation</em> (Neural) from <em>meaning verification</em> (Symbolic), we achieve a transparent reasoning chain. Every AI output is accompanied by a checkable witness or proof certificate. This hybrid approach ensures that the resulting system is both linguistically flexible and mathematically rigorous, fulfilling the requirements for <strong>Trustworthy AI</strong> in high-stakes environments.

          <h2>Research Frontier: Fluid Semantic Interfacing</h2>
          <p>
            The primary challenge remains the efficiency of the <strong>Neuro-to-Symbolic Mapping</strong>. Current research is directed toward:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Correcting Agents:</strong> Enabling agents to autonomously refine their internal policies by interacting with the UBHNL reasoning kernel.</li>
            <li><strong>Probabilistic Constraints:</strong> Developing fragments that can handle statistical weights within a symbolic framework, allowing the system to verify "most likely" scenarios without sacrificing the checkability of the reasoning chain.</li>
          </ul>
