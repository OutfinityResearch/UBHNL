          <h2>The Use Case: The Logistics War Room</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine Marco, a logistics manager. His problem is a messy puzzle: he has hard "if-then" rules (refrigerated trucks), complex routes with millions of combinations (optimization), and uncertain weather patterns (probability). 
          </p>
          <p>
            No single "brain" is good at all these things. A specialized math solver might find the route but fail at the logic. A logical engine might understand the rules but drown in the math. Marco needs an <strong>Orchestra</strong>, where every instrument is a different type of solver. 
            <strong>UBHNL's Orchestrator is the Conductor.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>The Method: Fragments and Specialists</h2>
          <p>
            The secret to our "Universal" reasoning isn't one giant solver. It's the ability to recognize <strong>Fragments</strong>. When Marco asks a question, the Orchestrator looks at the request and breaks it apart. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If a part of the problem is pure Boolean logic, the Orchestrator sends it to our <strong>SAT+XOR Backend</strong>. If another part involves complex constraints on time or amounts, it might use an <strong>SMT</strong> engine. If Marco wants to know "How likely is this?", the <strong>Probabilistic Engine</strong> takes the lead. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Orchestrator's job is to build a "Plan"—a step-by-step map of how to lower these high-level fragments into the minimal language of the UBH Kernel. It manages the handoffs between specialists, ensuring that everyone is playing the same song.

          <h2>The Contract: Trust, not Faith</h2>
          <p>
            In many systems, you have to "have faith" that the solver is correct. Not in UBHNL. Here, the Orchestrator is a skeptic. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time a backend (a specialist) returns an answer, the Orchestrator demands a <strong>Certificate</strong>. If the specialist says "This is impossible," it must provide a proof (a DRAT or LRAT certificate). If it says "I found a solution," it must provide a witness (a model) that our own <strong>Trusted Core</strong> can verify. We don't trust the specialists; we only trust our ability to verify their homework. If a specialist can't prove its work, the Orchestrator returns <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>—a result far more honest and safer than a lucky guess.

          <h2>The Road Ahead: Smarter Conductors</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, our Orchestrator is a great delegator but a simple planner. We are working on <strong>Heuristic Guidance</strong>—teaching the Conductor to predict which specialist will be fastest for a new, unseen problem. We are also building "Certificate Translators" that take the raw, technical proofs from the backends and turn them into the Natural Language stories that people like Marco and Sarah can actually read.
