          <h2>The Formal Lexicon: A Unified Vocabulary</h2>
          <p>
            The foundational requirement for any deterministic reasoning system is a strictly defined vocabulary. In UBHNL, this is managed through the <strong>Lexicon</strong>, which acts as the authoritative registry for all types, domains, and allowed symbols. Every symbol utilized within the system—whether in natural-sounding CNL or symbolic DSL—must be explicitly declared. Any attempt to reference an undeclared symbol results in a mandatory load error. This policy prevents the "silent failure" common in less rigorous systems, where typos or undefined terms are erroneously interpreted as new variables. The primary sources for this vocabulary are <code>.sys2</code> schema files and <code>.cnl</code> domain definitions, which establish the ontological grounding for the reasoning engine.
          </p>

          <h2>Controlled Natural Language (CNL): Deterministic Semantics</h2>
          <p>
            CNL is a restricted subset of natural language designed to eliminate lexical and syntactic ambiguity. While it maintains a surface similarity to English, it enforces a strict <strong>SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)</strong> structure and requires explicit quantification and scoping. The parser rejects any construction that allows for multiple interpretations, forcing the author to rephrase the intent into a deterministic form. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Determinism is maintained through several key rules: all quantifiers must be bound to a specific domain (e.g., <code>For any Patient p: ...</code>), every predicate must match the arity and argument types defined in the lexicon, and any symbol not previously declared is treated as a hard error. This ensures that the high-level intent of the domain expert is captured with the same mathematical precision as a formal programming language.
          </p>

          <h2>The DSL (sys2): Machine-Efficient Canonical IR</h2>
          <p>
            While CNL is optimized for human readability, the <strong>DSL (sys2)</strong> provides a compact and canonical representation for theory files. The DSL is structured around a few fundamental tokens: <code>@name</code> indicates a statement target or declaration, <code>$name</code> represents a reference to a variable or expression currently in scope, and a "bare" name represents a direct lookup in the persistent vocabulary. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This symbolic format is designed for maximum reproducibility and ease of automated processing. It supports persistent KB declarations, fact statements, and complex logical blocks. Because the DSL and CNL are semantically isomorphic, the system can seamlessly translate between them, allowing for a workflow where rules are authored in natural language but stored and executed in the symbolic DSL format.

          <h2>Grammatical Safety and Error Detection</h2>
          <p>
            The system's commitment to determinism is reflected in its <strong>Grammatical Safety</strong> policies. For example, the DSL prohibits multiple <code>@</code> tokens on a single line to ensure clear statement boundaries. If a rule attempts to reference an unknown predicate or a constant that has not been registered in the lexicon, the system halts execution with a detailed load error. This proactive verification ensures that only semantically sound theories reach the reasoning backends, significantly reducing the surface area for logical errors in the final proofs.
