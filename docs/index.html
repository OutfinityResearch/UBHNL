          <h2>The Rational Necessity for Formal Verification</h2>
          <p>
            As Artificial Intelligence systems move into critical decision-making roles, the limitations of purely probabilistic models become increasingly evident. In high-risk environments, "most likely" answers are insufficient; what is required is <strong>Deterministic Reasoning</strong> backed by checkable evidence. UBHNL addresses this by providing a "System 2" architecture—a methodical, rule-based reasoning layer that complements the creative flexibility of neural models with the absolute rigors of mathematical verification.

          <h2>Foundational Principles</h2>
          <p>
            The UBHNL paradigm is governed by three non-negotiable architectural axioms. <strong>Radical Minimalism</strong> ensures the trusted kernel remains small enough for formal audit. The principle of <strong>Result Verification</strong> mandates that every claim must be supported by a checkable witness or certificate. Finally, <strong>Semantic Isomorphism</strong> provides a unified representation where natural-sounding language (CNL) and machine-efficient code (DSL) are mathematically identical, ensuring that human intent and machine execution are perfectly aligned.
