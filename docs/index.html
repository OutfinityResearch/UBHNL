          <h2>What is AGISystem2 (UBH NL)?</h2>
          <p>
            AGISystem2 (UBH NL) is an <strong>AI research platform</strong> inspired by the <em>System 2</em> concept from cognitive psychology—the slow, deliberate, logical mode of human reasoning (as opposed to System 1's fast, intuitive responses). The platform brings together formal verification, neural-symbolic hybrid reasoning, and a minimal Boolean substrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key innovation is the introduction of a <strong>Controlled Natural Language (CNL)</strong> and a matched <strong>semantic programming language (DSL)</strong> that give formal, machine-verifiable meaning to structured fragments of language. Instead of teaching humans to write in formal logic, we utilize a language that captures the semantic structure <em>implicit</em> in common reasoning patterns. The result is <strong>machine-checkable reasoning</strong> over <strong>formally modeled</strong> content, backed by mathematical proofs and deterministic evaluation.

          <h2>The Vision: Universal Reasoning System</h2>
          <p>
            AGISystem2 (UBH NL) is driven by a core hypothesis: a plausible route toward "real" AGI goes through the ability to represent and manipulate <strong>theories as computational objects</strong>—compositional, queryable, checkable, and revisable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We utilize a <strong>Universal Boolean Hypergraph (UBH)</strong> as a minimal trusted kernel. By lowering complex domain problems—be they medical, legal, or scientific—down to this universal substrate of bits and gates, we gain absolute auditability. The system does not "guess"; it solves for consistency and returns checkable certificates.

          <h2>What You Can Do With It (Today)</h2>
          <h3>Build checkable micro-theories</h3>
          <p>Encode structured facts and rules in CNL, query/prove them, and get explainable traces. This is the "unit of progress": small theories that are executable, inspectable, and testable.</p>
          
          <h3>Verify logical consistency</h3>
          <p>Detect contradictions across multiple regulatory documents or scientific papers. The system flags exactly which rules are mutually exclusive.</p>
          
          <h3>Use LLMs safely</h3>
          <p>LLMs can propose theory fragments or plans. AGISystem2’s job is to validate and harden those proposals with proofs, counterexamples, and reproducible workflows.</p>

          <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            For applications where <strong>verification is critical</strong>—compliance, medical decisions, legal reasoning, safety-critical systems—probabilistic pattern matching alone isn't enough. AGISystem2 (UBH NL) provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof traces:</strong> Every conclusion traces back to facts and rules via origin tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Contradiction detection:</strong> The system identifies and explains inconsistencies in knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Reproducible results:</strong> Deterministic parsing and solving ensure the same input always produces the same output.</li>
            <li><strong>Checkable evidence:</strong> Results are only accepted when accompanied by a witness or a certificate.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Scope & Honesty</h2>
          <p><strong>What AGISystem2 (UBH NL) does well:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Taxonomic reasoning and rule-based inference.</li>
            <li>Explicit contradiction detection within formalized domains.</li>
            <li>Generating checkable proof certificates for every conclusion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>What it does NOT do:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open-ended conversation or emotional intelligence.</li>
            <li>Automatically "knowing" a domain without explicit modeling effort.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Fundamental limitation: The system reasons correctly within a theory, but cannot guarantee the theory itself is correct.</em></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Foundational Principles</h2>
          <p>
            The UBHNL paradigm is governed by three non-negotiable architectural axioms. <strong>Radical Minimalism</strong> ensures the trusted kernel remains small enough for formal audit. The principle of <strong>Result Verification</strong> mandates that every claim must be supported by a checkable witness or certificate. Finally, <strong>Semantic Isomorphism</strong> provides a unified representation where natural-sounding language (CNL) and machine-efficient code (DSL) are mathematically identical, ensuring that human intent and machine execution are perfectly aligned.
