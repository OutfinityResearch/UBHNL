          <h2>The Problem: Where Does Meaning Originate?</h2>
          <p>
            UBHNL promises deterministic verification of complex models. However, this raises a fundamental critique known as the <strong>Symbol Grounding Problem</strong> (Harnad, 1990): How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than remaining merely parasitic on the meanings in the minds of its users?
          </p>
          <p>
            If our "System 2" logic inherits its symbols from a probabilistic "System 1" (such as an LLM embedding), it risk inheriting hallucinations and biases. If the symbols are defined manually, the system suffers from the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck" that hindered early expert systems.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Stance: The Validity of the Critique</h2>
          <p>
            We do not claim to have solved the Symbol Grounding Problem. UBHNL does not discover "absolute truth" or ground symbols in intrinsic meaning. Instead, it provides a <strong>Meta-Rational Approach</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Truth within a Theory:</strong> UBHNL guarantees the logical consistency of conclusions <em>within</em> a specific theory (T ⊨ φ), not the correspondence of that theory to external reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Explicit Modeling:</strong> The system forces the formalization of assumptions, making them explicit, inspectable, and subject to systematic debugging.</li>
            <li><strong>Pragmatic Utility:</strong> We treat theories as tools for achieving specific goals (e.g., regulatory compliance, safety verification) rather than as perfect mirrors of reality.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Engineering Alternative: Iterative Refinement</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than pursuing the computationally intractable goal of universal semantics, UBHNL adopts a pragmatic engineering framework. We break complex reality into <strong>domain-specific, approximate theories</strong> that can be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tested:</strong> Comparing formal predictions against empirical observations.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugged:</strong> Identifying and resolving internal contradictions (UNSAT cores).</li>
            <li><strong>Revised:</strong> Updating definitions and rules as new evidence or requirements emerge.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Scope and Honesty</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding the limitations of formal systems is essential for their effective application. UBHNL does not replace human judgment; it enhances it by providing a deterministic environment for analyzing the <em>consequences</em> of our definitions. We explicitly reject the ideological fantasy that formal systems will achieve a "singularity" or replace the need for human-led scientific and ethical inquiry.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion: Theories as Instruments</h2>
          <p>
            1. The Symbol Grounding Problem remains a real and open challenge.<br />
            2. Universal semantics is likely impossible or computationally intractable.<br />
            3. UBHNL focuses on <strong>Intra-Theory Consistency</strong> and auditable reasoning.<br />
            4. Useful approximations are superior to perfect impossibilities.
