          <h2>The Bit as an Atomic Unit of Meaning</h2>
          <p>
            In UBHNL, the most fundamental unit of information is the <strong>Bit</strong>, represented as an element in the set <code>{0,1}</code>. Under a chosen interpretation or model, "Truth" is not an abstract concept but a concrete binary value. This grounding allows us to treat complex logical systems as large-scale Boolean functions.

          <h2>GF(2): The Algebraic Interpretation of Logic</h2>
          <p>
            The system interprets logic through the lens of <strong>GF(2)</strong> (the Galois Field of 2 elements). In this algebraic framework, the traditional logical Exclusive OR (XOR) corresponds to addition modulo 2, while the logical AND corresponds to multiplication. This mapping is significant because it transforms logical inference into polynomial manipulation. Specifically, <strong>XOR</strong> acts as the primary operator for addition (<code>a ⊕ b ↔ a + b mod 2</code>), and <strong>AND</strong> acts as the operator for multiplication (<code>a ∧ b ↔ a · b</code>).

          <h2>Completeness of the {XOR, AND, 1} Basis</h2>
          <p>
            A critical design choice in UBHNL is the use of the <code>{XOR, AND, 1}</code> basis. This set is functionally complete, meaning any Boolean function can be uniquely represented using only these operators. For instance, negation is derived as <code>¬x = 1 ⊕ x</code>, and the logical OR is expressed as <code>x ∨ y = x ⊕ y ⊕ (x ∧ y)</code>. From an engineering perspective, this allows the kernel to remain exceptionally lean, while richer logical operators—such as implication, arithmetic, and comparison—are implemented as macros that the front-end compiles down to this minimal algebraic core.

          <h2>Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) and Polynomial Consistency</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Algebraic Normal Form (ANF)</strong> theorem guarantees that every Boolean function has a unique representation as a multilinear polynomial over GF(2). This uniqueness is the theoretical anchor for our UBH IR. By treating logic as polynomials, UBHNL can leverage centuries of mathematical research in linear algebra and polynomial systems (such as Gaussian Elimination for XOR fragments) to solve consistency problems that are often computationally expensive for traditional CNF-based SAT solvers.

          <h2>Strategic Hybridization: SAT and Native XOR</h2>
          <p>
            While traditional SAT solvers typically require XOR constraints to be expanded into numerous OR clauses—leading to a significant "encoding blow-up"—UBHNL treats XOR as a first-class citizen. Our solver strategy is a <strong>SAT + Native XOR hybrid</strong>, which solves linear equations over bits using dedicated algebraic backends while simultaneously managing non-linear constraints through CDCL-style SAT solving.

          <h2>Current Implementation and Scalability</h2>
          <p>
            The existing kernel currently implements this algebraic foundation with high fidelity, supporting structural compression and native XOR/AND nodes. Future development is focused on expanding our "Bit-Blasting" libraries to automate the translation of higher-level types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, into these elegant GF(2) polynomials, thereby extending the reach of our formal verification to numerical reasoning.
