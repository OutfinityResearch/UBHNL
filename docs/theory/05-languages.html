          <h2>The Semantic Bridge</h2>
          <p>
            The effectiveness of a reasoning system is constrained by the precision of its input language. UBHNL addresses the inherent ambiguity of natural language by providing a <strong>Semantic Bridge</strong> consisting of two isomorphic representations: <strong>Controlled Natural Language (CNL)</strong> for human readability and <strong>DSL (sys2)</strong> for machine-efficient storage and processing. These languages share a single underlying logical soul, ensuring that no meaning is lost during translation.

          <h2>Controlled Natural Language: Eliminating Ambiguity</h2>
          <p>
            CNL is a restricted subset of English designed to be parsed deterministically. By enforcing strict syntactic patterns—such as the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure—CNL eliminates the referential ambiguity and scoping issues common in natural speech. Every statement in CNL, whether it is a fact (e.g., <code>Alice is a Patient</code>) or a universal rule (e.g., <code>Each Patient has a Temperature</code>), maps directly to a unique symbolic representation. This ensures that the user's intent is captured with the same rigor as a mathematical formula, while remaining accessible to domain experts who are not trained in formal logic.

          <h2>Semantic Isomorphism: CNL vs. DSL</h2>
          <p>
            A core architectural principle of UBHNL is the <strong>Isomorphism</strong> between its two front-end languages. A rule authored in natural-sounding CNL and its counterpart in the symbolic DSL (sys2) resolve to the exact same Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This property allows for a fluid workflow where experts can author and review theories in CNL, while automated tools and back-end solvers manipulate the compact DSL format. The system supports "round-trip" translation, enabling the output of a solver (originally in DSL) to be explained back to the user in the original CNL syntax.

          <h2>The Strict Lexicon and Type Safety</h2>
          <p>
            To maintain logical integrity, UBHNL operates under a <strong>Strict Lexicon</strong> policy. Every symbol—whether it is a domain, a constant, or a predicate—must be explicitly declared before it is used. This mandatory typing prevents the introduction of "silent errors," such as typos that would otherwise be interpreted as new, undefined variables. The Lexicon serves as the system's "shared dictionary," ensuring that both the human user and the machine solver are operating on a consistent set of definitions. Arity and argument types are validated during the parsing stage, catching semantic mismatches before they reach the reasoning engine.

          <h2>Future Extensions: Beyond SVO Patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Current development is focused on expanding the <strong>Grammar Expressivity</strong> of the CNL. We are developing natural patterns for temporal constraints ("after T has elapsed"), probabilistic assertions ("with probability P"), and complex aggregations. These extensions are designed to maintain the deterministic nature of the parser while providing experts with the tools needed to describe increasingly sophisticated domain behaviors.
