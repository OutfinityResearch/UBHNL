          <h2>The Use Case: The Compliance Officer</h2>
          <p>
            Sarah is a compliance officer at a large bank. She needs to ensure that thousands of transactions follow the law: 
            <em>"If a transaction is over $10,000 and the sender is from a high-risk region, then it must be flagged for review."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sarah isn't a coder, but she is a logic expert. UBHNL gives her a <strong>Controlled Natural Language (CNL)</strong> that looks like English but acts like code.
          </p>

          <h2>CNL: English without the "Oops"</h2>
          <p>
            Human language is messy. "I saw the man with the telescope" (Did I use the telescope, or did he have it?). 
            UBHNL uses <strong>Controlled Natural Language</strong> to remove this ambiguity. It uses strict patterns like:
            <ul>
              <li><code>X has Y</code> (e.g., <em>Transaction has HighRiskSender.</em>)</li>
              <li><code>X is Y</code> (e.g., <em>Alice is a Manager.</em>)</li>
              <li><code>If P then Q</code> (e.g., <em>If amount > 10000 then Flag(transaction).</em>)</li>
            </ul>
            By following these patterns, Sarah can write rules that the computer understands <em>exactly</em> as she intended.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Two Skins, One Soul: CNL vs. DSL</h2>
          <p>
            While Sarah loves the CNL, developers might prefer something more structured. UBHNL provides an <strong>isomorphism</strong>: 
            Every sentence in Sarah's English-like CNL has a 1-to-1 equivalent in our <strong>DSL (sys2)</strong>.
          </p>
          <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="cnl-side">
              <strong>CNL (Human)</strong><br/>
              <code>Every Patient with Flu has Fever.</code>
            </div>
            <div class="arrow">↔</div>
            <div class="dsl-side">
              <strong>DSL (Machine)</strong><br/>
              <code>@rule1 ForAll Patient graph p<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implies { HasFlu $p } { HasFever $p }<br/>end</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            You can swap between them at any time. The system doesn't care which one you use—the underlying logic remains identical.
          </p>

          <h2>The Lexicon: The Common Dictionary</h2>
          <p>
            How does the system know what a "Patient" or "Flu" is? Through the <strong>Lexicon</strong>. 
            Before you start writing rules, you define your "vocabulary". This ensures that the system is <strong>Strictly Typed</strong>. If Sarah mentions a "Symptom" that isn't in her lexicon, the system will politely stop her and ask for a definition.

          <h2>Where we are going</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>What we have:</strong> A deterministic translator that handles SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) patterns and complex quantifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What we need:</strong> We are working on <strong>Grammar Extensions</strong>. We want to support more natural ways of expressing time ("After a transaction is flagged...") and uncertainty ("It is 80% likely that...").
