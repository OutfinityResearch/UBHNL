          <h2>The Use Case: The Logistics Manager</h2>
          <p>
            Marco is a logistics manager for a global shipping company. His day is a mix of different problems:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Logical Rules:</strong> "If a truck is refrigerated, it can carry medicine."</li>
              <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> "Find the cheapest route that meets all delivery times."</li>
              <li><strong>Probability:</strong> "What is the chance of a delay due to the storm?"</li>
            </ul>
            No single solver is good at all of these. Marco needs a <strong>Conductor</strong> who can delegate each part of the problem to the right specialist.

          <h2>The Orchestrator: The Brain behind the Plan</h2>
          <p>
            In UBHNL, the <strong>Orchestrator</strong> is the brain that manages complexity. It doesn't just throw everything at a SAT solver. Instead, it follows a sophisticated process:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Fragment Detection:</strong> It looks at the problem and says: "This part is linear math, this part is simple logic, and this part is a search for a witness."</li>
              <li><strong>The Plan:</strong> It builds a <em>Plan DAG</em>—a step-by-step strategy for how to solve the puzzle.</li>
              <li><strong>Delegation:</strong> It sends the fragments to specialized <strong>Backends</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Fragments: The Building Blocks of Complexity</h2>
          <p>
            We call these specialized parts <strong>Fragments</strong>. 
            By breaking a "Universal" problem into smaller, well-defined fragments, we can use the most efficient tools for each job. A simple logic puzzle doesn't need a supercomputer, but a complex optimization might. The Orchestrator knows the difference.

          <h2>Type Lowering: The Universal Translation</h2>
          <p>
            How does the Orchestrator communicate with all these different specialists? Through <strong>Type Lowering</strong>. 
            It takes high-level concepts (like "Trucks" and "Routes") and translates them into the minimal language of the UBH Kernel: <strong>Bits and Wires</strong>. This ensures that even though many specialists are involved, they all agree on the final "Ground Truth."

          <h2>Current Limits & Future Plans</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>What we have:</strong> A flexible orchestrator that can route problems to SAT solvers and check their results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What we're building:</strong> <em>Smarter Planning.</em> We are teaching the Orchestrator to estimate the "Difficulty" of a problem before it starts. This will allow it to choose better strategies and give Marco faster results for his logistics routes.
