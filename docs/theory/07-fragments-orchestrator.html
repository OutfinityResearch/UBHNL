          <h2>The Orchestration Challenge: Multi-Fragment Reasoning</h2>
          <p>
            Real-world problems rarely fit into a single logical category. A typical complex query—such as a logistics optimization subject to safety regulations—may contain hard Boolean constraints, linear arithmetic, and probabilistic estimations. To handle this diversity without building a massive, monolithic solver, UBHNL utilizes an <strong>Orchestration Layer</strong>. This layer acts as a centralized planner that coordinates a specialized fleet of backends, each optimized for a specific mathematical domain.

          <h2>Fragment Classification and Tactical Planning</h2>
          <p>
            The core of the orchestration process is <strong>Fragment Detection</strong>. When a query is submitted, the Orchestrator analyzes the semantic IR to identify its constituent logical fragments. A fragment is a restricted subset of logic (e.g., XOR-linear, Horn-clause, or Bit-Vector arithmetic) for which efficient decision procedures are known. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this classification, the Orchestrator constructs a <strong>Plan DAG</strong>—a directed acyclic graph of tasks that describes the sequence of lowering, solving, and verification steps required to reach a conclusion. This tactical approach ensures that the most appropriate tool is used for each component of the problem.

          <h2>Pluggable Backends and the Verification Contract</h2>
          <p>
            Universality is achieved through <strong>Backend Specialization</strong>. UBHNL does not rely on a single algorithm; instead, it delegates work to a variety of specialized engines, including SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers. To maintain system integrity, these backends are treated as untrusted. Every result must be accompanied by checkable evidence (a witness or a certificate), which is validated by the <strong>Trusted Core</strong>. This separation allows the system to incorporate state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining a rigorous, proof-based verification contract.

          <h2>Type Lowering: The Unified Boolean Substrate</h2>
          <p>
            The communication between high-level theory and low-level backends is facilitated through <strong>Type Lowering</strong>. This process translates sophisticated domain concepts into the minimal, universal language of the UBH Kernel: bits and gates. This ensures that regardless of the original fragment, all reasoning is ultimately grounded in the same Boolean substrate, providing a unified foundation for consistency checking across all backends.

          <h2>Research Frontiers: Heuristic-Guided Planning</h2>
          <p>
            Current research is directed toward <strong>Adaptive Planning</strong>. We are developing heuristic models that allow the Orchestrator to estimate the computational complexity of a problem fragment before execution. This will enable the system to dynamically adjust budgets, choose between competing backend tactics, and optimize the overall reasoning time for large-scale industrial applications.
