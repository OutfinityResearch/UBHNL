          <h2>Persistence vs. Transience</h2>
          <p>
            In any reasoning workflow, there is a fundamental distinction between <strong>Persistent Theory</strong> and <strong>Transient Observation</strong>. Persistent knowledge consists of stable, foundational axioms (e.g., biological laws or legal statutes) that are stored on disk as theory files. Transient knowledge, however, represents the ephemeral state of a specific experiment or "what-if" scenario. UBHNL manages this duality through the <strong>Session</strong>—a temporary workspace that allows for rapid iteration without corrupting the authoritative knowledge base.

          <h2>The Session as a Structured Workspace</h2>
          <p>
            A UBHNL Session acts as an active memory layer. It begins by loading the persistent theory files, which serve as the "ground truth." Within this environment, users can perform <strong>Learn</strong> operations to add transient facts or temporary rules. These additions are local to the session and do not persist to disk, enabling researchers and engineers to explore hypothetical states—such as "inhibiting a protein" or "modeling a specific transaction"—while maintaining the integrity of the underlying theory.

          <h2>Origin Tracking and Conflict Attribution</h2>
          <p>
            Every statement within a session—whether loaded from a file or learned interactively—is tagged with a unique <strong>Origin</strong>. These origins serve as a digital fingerprint, recording the exact source of the information (e.g., file path, line number, or input ID). This metadata is critical for explainability. If the system detects a logical contradiction (UNSAT), it uses these origins to pinpoint the exact set of conflicting statements. By attributing conflicts to their sources, the system can distinguish between a flaw in the foundational theory and an inconsistency in the transient observations added during the session.

          <h2>Incremental Reasoning and Caching</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure high performance during iterative querying, the Session implements <strong>Artifact Caching</strong>. The reasoning process is computationally expensive, particularly for large theories. The session tracks the dependencies between rules and their lowered Boolean representations. If a user adds a small set of transient facts, the system only re-evaluates the affected sub-graphs of the theory, reusing cached results for the untouched portions. This incremental approach allows for near-instantaneous feedback during interactive exploration.

          <h2>Future Capabilities: Collaborative State Management</h2>
          <p>
            Ongoing research is exploring <strong>Distributed Session Management</strong>. This would enable multiple users to share a common persistent theory while managing their own local deltas, potentially merging successful transient findings back into the authoritative theory. This evolution aims to transform the session from a solitary workspace into a collaborative environment for large-scale formal modeling.
