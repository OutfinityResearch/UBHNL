          <h2>The Use Case: The Expert's Dilemma</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine a doctor, Dr. Elena, who has spent decades understanding how diseases spread. She wants to encode her knowledge into a system: 
            <em>"If a patient has the Flu, they will almost certainly have a Fever."</em> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Elena faces a choice: use a "Black Box" AI that gives answers without reasons, or a complex programming language she doesn't understand. 
            <strong>UBHNL exists to solve this dilemma.</strong> It allows Elena to speak her mind in Natural Language, while ensuring that every conclusion the system reaches is backed by a mathematical proof.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why: The "Why" behind UBHNL</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional reasoning systems are often monolithic and rigid. UBHNL is built on a different philosophy: <strong>Universal Reasoning through Minimal Substrates.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't try to build one giant solver for every problem. Instead, we build a tiny, trusted <strong>Kernel</strong> (UBH) that only understands bits and basic logic gates. By lowering complex problems—be they medical, legal, or hardware-related—down to this "universal language of bits," we gain something priceless: <strong>Trust.</strong>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How: The Journey from Words to Wires</h2>
          <p>
            When Dr. Elena enters a rule, the system doesn't just "read" it. It takes it through a journey:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>The Human Interface:</strong> The Controlled Natural Language (CNL) captures her intent without the ambiguity of common speech.</li>
            <li><strong>The Lowering:</strong> The Orchestrator takes these high-level concepts and "bit-blasts" them into a Boolean Hypergraph.</li>
            <li><strong>The Trusted Core:</strong> The UBH Kernel receives these raw wires and gates. It doesn't know about "Flu" or "Patients"—it only knows about consistency and contradictions.</li>
            <li><strong>The Certificate:</strong> Once a solution is found, the system generates a <em>Certificate</em>. This is the "receipt" of reasoning—a proof that anyone (or any simple program) can check to verify the doctor's conclusion.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What: The Architecture of Trust</h2>
          <p>
            UBHNL is structured in layers to keep the "Brain" separated from the "Mouth":
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-ends:</strong> Handle the human side (CNL, DSL, Lexicons).</li>
            <li><strong>The Orchestrator:</strong> The master planner that decides which solver to use and how to break the problem apart.</li>
            <li><strong>The Kernel:</strong> The minimal substrate where the actual math happens.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Current Limits & What's Next</h2>
          <p>
            While the foundations are strong, we are still perfecting the <strong>Orchestrator's Planning</strong>. Currently, the system excels at "exact" logic (SAT/UNSAT). We are moving towards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Probabilistic Reasoning:</strong> Handling "Elena's <em>usually</em>" instead of just "always".</li>
            <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Turning the raw mathematical proof back into a story that Elena can read and understand.</li>
          </ul>
