          <h2>The Use Case: The Courtroom</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine a courtroom. A prosecutor stands up and says: "The defendant is guilty." The judge doesn't just say "Okay" and close the case. The judge demands <strong>Evidence</strong> and a <strong>Logical Argument</strong> that connects that evidence to the crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            In UBHNL, our Solver is the Judge. When it claims that a set of rules is impossible (UNSAT), it must provide a <strong>Certificate</strong>—a step-by-step proof that anyone can verify to ensure no mistakes were made.
          </p>

          <h2>The Three Answers: SAT, UNSAT, and UNKNOWN</h2>
          <p>
            Most software gives you "True" or "False". UBHNL is more honest. It has three possible responses:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>SAT (Satisfiable):</strong> "I found a way to make this work. Here is the <em>Witness</em> (a model) to prove it."</li>
              <li><strong>UNSAT (Unsatisfiable):</strong> "This is mathematically impossible. Here is the <em>Certificate</em> (the proof) that shows the contradiction."</li>
              <li><strong>UNKNOWN:</strong> "I don't know yet. Maybe the problem is too hard, or I ran out of time, or I'm using a method that isn't precise enough."</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>The Hybrid Engine: SAT + XOR</h2>
          <p>
            How does the "Judge" reach a verdict so quickly? By using two specialized specialists:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The SAT Specialist:</strong> Great at handling "If-Then" rules and complex dependencies using a method called CDCL.</li>
              <li><strong>The XOR Specialist:</strong> A math whiz who handles linear equations over bits (GF(2)) using Gaussian Elimination.</li>
            </ol>
            By letting these two specialists talk to each other, UBHNL can solve problems that would be hundreds of times larger if we only used one method.

          <h2>Explainability: Why did this happen?</h2>
          <p>
            If the system finds a contradiction, it can pinpoint exactly which rules caused the problem. This is called an <strong>Unsat Core</strong>. 
            For our doctor, Elena, this means the system can say: "Your rules are contradictory because Rule A says 'Fever is required' but Rule B says 'Fever is impossible' for this specific patient."

          <h2>Limits & Future: The Quest for Better Proofs</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>What we have:</strong> A system that returns certificates for its claims, ensuring that we never have to "blindly trust" the solver.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What we're building:</strong> <em>Human-Readable Proofs.</em> Currently, our certificates are in machine-readable formats like DRAT or LRAT. They are great for computers, but hard for humans. We are working on a <strong>Proof Translator</strong> that turns these mathematical traces back into Natural Language stories.
