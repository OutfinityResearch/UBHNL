          <h2>The Medical Detective</h2>
          <p>
            A patient walks into a clinic with a fever and a cough. The system doesn't just guess. It looks at its <strong>Medical Theory</strong>: <em>"Flu causes fever and cough. A common cold causes a cough but rarely a high fever."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The system performs <strong>Abduction</strong>. It asks: "What disease, if present, would explain these observations?" 
            <strong>The Result:</strong> The system suggests "Flu" as a likely witness, providing the logical chain that connects the disease to the symptoms.

          <h2>The Chain of Trust</h2>
          <p>
            In a digital social network, Alice trusts Bob, and Bob trusts Charlie. Does Alice trust Charlie? 
            The system applies a <strong>Transitivity Rule</strong>: <em>"If X trusts Y, and Y trusts Z, then X trusts Z."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is <strong>Deduction</strong>. The system follows the links, building a bridge of trust from Alice to Charlie. It doesn't just say "Yes"—it shows the path it took through the network.

          <h2>The Ethical Switch</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine a safety system for a power plant. A switch cannot be both ON and OFF at the same time. This is a <strong>Consistency Constraint</strong>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If a faulty sensor reports that the switch is both ON and OFF, the system detects a <strong>Conflict</strong>. It returns <strong>UNSAT</strong> and points exactly to the sensor data and the safety rule that are clashing. It prevents the system from making a dangerous decision based on contradictory data.

          <h2>The Ancestor's Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            In a genealogical database, we know who everyone's parents are. But how do we find an ancestor from five generations ago? 
            We use a <strong>Recursive Rule</strong>: <em>"Your parent is your ancestor. Your parent's ancestor is also your ancestor."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The system uses <strong>Fixed-Point Reasoning</strong> to climb the family tree, connecting long-lost relatives through a rock-solid chain of "Parent-of" facts.
          </p>

          <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            These aren't just stories—they are <strong>Verified Test Suites</strong>. You can run them yourself to see the system in action:
          </p>
          <pre><code>node evals/runFastEval.mjs</code></pre>
          <p>
            This command runs 14 different scenarios, from physics to linguistics, proving that UBHNL's narrative approach works across every domain.
