          <h2>Case Study 1: Epistemic Abduction in Medical Diagnostics</h2>
          <p>
            In the domain of medical informatics, UBHNL can be utilized for <strong>Abductive Reasoning</strong> to identify diseases that explain observed symptoms. When presented with a patient exhibit (e.g., high temperature and cough), the system queries its medical theory to find diseases whose causal rules entail the observations. Unlike a probabilistic guess, the system returns a <strong>Witness</strong>—a specific disease state—along with the logical chain from the theory that justifies why this disease is a sufficient explanation for the patient's condition.

          <h2>Case Study 2: Relational Transitivity in Social Networks</h2>
          <p>
            The system excels at <strong>Deductive Inference</strong> over relational structures. In a social network context, transitivity rules (e.g., "If X trusts Y, and Y trusts Z, then X trusts Z") can be applied to large graphs. By querying for the existence of trust between two nodes, the Orchestrator explores the transitive closure of the trust relation. The result is a proof that demonstrates how the conclusion is derived from the atomic facts and the transitivity rule, ensuring that every link in the reasoning chain is explicit and auditable.

          <h2>Case Study 3: Conflict Detection in Safety-Critical Systems</h2>
          <p>
            For safety-critical environments, UBHNL is used to detect <strong>Internal Contradictions</strong> within sensor data and operational constraints. If multiple sensors provide mutually exclusive data (e.g., a switch reported as both ON and OFF), the system identifies the violation of the <strong>Exclusion Invariant</strong>. The output is an <strong>UNSAT Core</strong>, pinpointing the specific conflicting inputs and rules. This prevents the system from reaching a dangerous state based on inconsistent information, providing a mathematical guarantee of operational safety.

          <h2>Case Study 4: Fixed-Point Reasoning in Genealogy</h2>
          <p>
            The system handles <strong>Recursive Definitions</strong> through fixed-point reasoning, common in genealogical or hierarchical datasets. By defining ancestors recursively (e.g., "A parent is an ancestor; a parent's ancestor is also an ancestor"), UBHNL can verify ancestral relationships across any number of generations. The solver identifies a satisfying witness for the relationship, providing the full lineage as evidence of the connection, thus demonstrating the system's ability to handle recursive properties within a finite domain.

          <h2>Verification and Evaluation</h2>
          <p>
            These case studies are formalized as part of the <strong>UBHNL Evaluation Suite</strong>. These tests, ranging from physics to linguistics, ensure that the system maintains its accuracy across diverse logical fragments. Developers can execute these formal benchmarks to verify that new backends or language features do not compromise the integrity of the core reasoning engine:
          </p>
          <pre><code>node evals/runFastEval.mjs</code></pre>
          <p>
            The results of these evaluations provide the primary metric for the system's performance, coverage, and proof-generation reliability.
