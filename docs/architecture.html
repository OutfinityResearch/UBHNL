          <h2>Core Philosophy: Minimizing the Trusted Computing Base</h2>
          <p>
            The UBHNL architecture is predicated on the principle of <strong>Functional Isolation</strong>. We distinguish between the untrusted layers that handle complex language and planning, and the tiny, trusted core that performs the actual mathematical validation. This separation ensures that even if a complex solver or parser fails, the integrity of the final proof remains protected.

          <h2>The Semantic Layer: Interface and Normalization</h2>
          <p>
            The "Front-End" of the architecture is responsible for mapping human intent to formal logic. This layer utilizes <strong>Semantic Isomorphism</strong>: whether a rule is authored in natural-sounding CNL or symbolic DSL, the underlying AST is identical. The use of a strict <strong>Lexicon</strong> ensures that the system is closed under its own vocabulary, preventing the introduction of undefined symbols or ambiguous semantics.

          <h2>The Orchestration Layer: Fragmentation and Tactics</h2>
          <p>
            The "Orchestrator" acts as the strategist. It analyzes the formal theory to identify its <strong>Logical Fragment</strong> (e.g., Boolean, SMT, or Temporal). Based on this classification, it constructs a <strong>Plan DAG</strong>—a sequence of lowering, solving, and checking tasks. This layer allows UBHNL to be universal: it doesn't rely on a single solver but instead delegates fragments to specialized, pluggable backends.

          <h2>The Trusted Core: Validation via UBH</h2>
          <p>
            At the foundation lies the <strong>UBH Kernel</strong>. This is the only part of the system that must be implicitly trusted. It operates on a minimal set of Boolean gates (XOR and AND) using a <strong>Hash-Consed DAG</strong> for maximal structural sharing. Its primary responsibility is not solving, but <strong>Verification</strong>. It validates the "certificates" (proofs or witnesses) returned by the backends, ensuring that no result is accepted without checkable evidence.

          <h2>Current State and Scalability</h2>
          <p>
            The current architecture is highly modular, allowing for the addition of new backends without altering the kernel. Future development is directed toward <strong>Distributed Orchestration</strong> and <strong>Incremental Proof Checking</strong>, enabling the system to reason over theories consisting of millions of constraints while maintaining near-instantaneous verification times.
