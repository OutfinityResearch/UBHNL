    <h1>Design Choices</h1>
    <p>Short rationale for the main architectural decisions.</p>

    <h2>Kernel IR</h2>
    <p>
      XOR/AND/CONST gates over GF(2) give a minimal, universal Boolean basis with
      a direct polynomial interpretation and efficient structural hashing.
    </p>

    <h2>Solver Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      A SAT backbone with native XOR reasoning avoids CNF blowups and matches the
      circuit structure typical of UBH workloads.
    </p>

    <h2>Schema Engine</h2>
    <p>
      Quantifiers are handled with lazy instantiation to avoid full grounding and
      keep large theories compact.
    </p>

    <h2>CNL Front-end</h2>
    <p>
      Controlled natural language trades expressivity for deterministic parsing
      and predictable compilation to the kernel.
